Love is no longer about connection - it‚Äôs about convenience.\n\nLooks matter more than loyalty. A six-pack gets more respect than a kind heart.\n\nLuxury is being bought on EMI. We‚Äôd rather impress strangers than build real financial stability.\n\nSuccess is about looking successful. People rent expensive cars for Instagram but can‚Äôt afford their rent.\n\nFriendships are based on utility. \"What can you do for me?\" matters more than genuine care.\n\nBreakups are text messages. Ghosting is normal. Cheating is just a \"mistake.\"\n\nMarriage is seen as a burden. People want weddings, not lifelong commitments.\n\nJobs drain us. We work long hours, burn out, and call it \"hustle.\"\n\nCheating is normal. People call it a \"mistake\" while someone‚Äôs life falls apart.\n\nFake people win. The ones who manipulate, step over others, and lie get ahead.\n\nMental health is a trend. Everyone posts about it, but no one listens when someone truly struggles.\n\nSuccess is about flexing, not achieving. Rent a luxury car, post a reel, fool the world.\n\nKindness is a performance. Show empathy online, be rude in real life.\n\nRelationships are temporary. Love today, cheat tomorrow, move on the next day.\n\nLoyalty is outdated. Who needs commitment when you have options?\n\nIf you're kind, pure, and loyal, this world will use you, break you, and leave you behind.\n\nIf you're too nice, people will take advantage of you.\n\nIf you're too honest, people will call you na√Øve.\n\nIf you're too loyal, people will treat you like an option.\n\nIf you're too genuine, people will think you're weak.\n\nWe chase things we don‚Äôt even want - just because the world tells us to.\n\nWe seek validation from people who wouldn‚Äôt even show up to our funeral.\n\nWe‚Äôre so scared of being left out that we forget what actually matters.\n\nMaybe the problem isn‚Äôt society. Maybe it‚Äôs us.\nMaybe we need to stop chasing, stop flexing, stop pretending.\n\nMaybe the real flex is peace.\n\nMaybe real success is having people who love you.\n\nMaybe true happiness is living for yourself, not for likes.\n\nP.s - The writer in me was dying to come out today and write!! So, sorry for the long post :)\n\nand thank you everyone for supporting me, unknowingly you all make me smile :)))",

Some people sprint, some people jog, and some (like me) take snack breaks every five minutes. The goal is to *not burn out before reaching the finish line.*\n\nSo if you need a break, take it. If you want to rest, do it guilt-free. *Your worth is not measured by how many ‚Äògrindset‚Äô reels you watch.*\n\nAnd remember, even your phone needs to recharge. So why shouldn‚Äôt you?\n\nP.s - If you read till here, I am just curious about why you follow me, like what exactly do you like about my posts? I have been doing some analysis, and I hope to bring something more on the table that you'll like :))\n\nYou guys have met Luna already, now meet Shadow (I adopted Shadow from my college and she lives in my hometown with my family, honestly she's my first child :).

But having a structured approach helped me stay sane and maximize my chances.\n\nHere‚Äôs what worked:\n\n1. Resume = First Impression Matters-\n\nTailored my resume for different roles (not rewriting, just tweaking keywords).\n\nMade sure the first two lines of each job experience showed impact, not just tasks.\n\n2. Applied Smart, Not Just Fast-\n\nPrioritized companies that matched my skill set instead of mass applying.\n\nUsed LinkedIn, Wellfound, and Naukri for targeted searches.\n\nCold messaged hiring managers when possible (not just ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù but value-driven messages).\n\n3. Interviewing: Storytelling & Clarity Over Buzzwords-\n\nFor behavioral rounds: Used STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result) but kept it conversational.\n\nFor technical rounds: Thought out loud, asked clarifying questions, and didn‚Äôt rush to the answer.\n\nP.S - I even solved a differential/integration question in one of the interviews, so be ready for everything :)\n\n4. Post-Interview: The Follow-Up That Works-\n\nSent thoughtful follow-up emails that reiterated my strengths & interest.\n\nIf rejected, always ask for feedback and refine your approach.\n\nHope this helps :)",

People now ask AI.\n- Can't decide what to wear? People ask AI.\n- Feeling sad or lonely? Some vent to AI instead of calling a friend.\n\nWhile AI can be helpful, relying on it for every decision is dangerous. We're outsourcing our thinking, creativity, and even emotions to algorithms.\n\nThe result? People are becoming less independent, less connected, and more isolated.\n\nAI is a tool - use it wisely. Because no chatbot can replace the warmth of a real conversation or the comfort of someone who genuinely cares.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is AI making us smarter or just more dependent?",

    "Text": "Imagine spending weeks perfecting your resume. Hours crafting the perfect cover letter. Days preparing for an interview that never comes ‚Äî because the job itself was never real.\n\nThis is ghost hiring.\n\nWhat is Ghost Hiring?\n\nGhost hiring is when companies post job openings that they have no intention of filling. Sometimes it's to:\n\n1. Collect Resumes ‚Äî Building a talent pool for future needs.\n\n2. Show Growth ‚Äî To appear as if the company is expanding.\n\n3. Keep Employees on Edge ‚Äî Making internal teams believe they can be replaced.\n\n4. Satisfy Policies ‚Äî Companies might post jobs just to meet the internal hiring process requirements, even if they‚Äôve already chosen a candidate.\n\nBut what does this mean for job seekers? It‚Äôs heartbreaking.\n\nYou refresh your inbox every day, hoping for an update. You convince yourself you didn‚Äôt get a reply because maybe they‚Äôre busy - or maybe you need to improve your skills.\n\nIn reality, you never stood a chance because the role wasn‚Äôt real in the first place.\n\nThe Emotional Impact:\nGhost hiring doesn‚Äôt just waste time - it crushes self-esteem. Candidates start questioning their worth. They feel like they aren‚Äôt ‚Äògood enough,‚Äô when in reality, they were never even considered.\n\nIt leads to:\n- Imposter Syndrome ‚Äî ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just not skilled enough.‚Äù\n\n- Burnout ‚Äî Applying to hundreds of roles without meaningful responses.\n\n- Anxiety & Depression ‚Äî Feeling powerless in your career.\n\nTo those facing this:\n\nIt‚Äôs *not your fault*. The silence you‚Äôre experiencing isn‚Äôt a reflection of your skills or talent. Sometimes, the system itself is broken.\n\nWhat can job seekers do?\n\n1. Ask Directly: During interviews, ask, ‚ÄúIs this role budget-approved and actively being hired for?‚Äù Genuine recruiters will answer honestly.\n\n2. Watch for Red Flags: If a role is repeatedly reposted but no one you know has been hired, that‚Äôs a warning sign.\n\n3. Focus on Networking: Referrals often bypass the ‚Äúghost‚Äù stage because you‚Äôre connected to someone inside.\n\nAnd to companies practicing ghost hiring:\nPlease understand - these are real people. Behind every resume is a person battling self-doubt, holding on to hope, and trying to build a future.\n\nIf you're posting jobs you don‚Äôt plan to fill, remember this: Your ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô is someone else‚Äôs heartbreak.\n\nTo everyone who is still applying despite the silence - you are strong, resilient, and capable.\n\nOne day, the right opportunity will come - and when it does, it will be *real*.",
